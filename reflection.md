- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    The differences between Python help me conclude that programming in general is very diverse and that languages are tailored to specific needs. For example, Python is (at least to me) more straightforward and readable while Java has a lot of structure which might help it run more robust programs. I think the strengths and weaknesses of each language can help programmers use a language that is most hepful for their project.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I had a lot of issues in the beginning of this assignment with conflicting scanners, so I just decided to use the try()-finally() block to be able to use the same scanner for the whole program and make sure the scanner closes even if an exception is thrown earlier in the program.
